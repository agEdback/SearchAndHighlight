[info] but for now we'll just set up a default project.
[info] 
[info] i  .firebaserc already has a default project, using psychological-sentences.

=== Hosting Setup
[info] 
[info] Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that
[info] will contain Hosting assets to be uploaded with firebase deploy. If you
[info] have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.
